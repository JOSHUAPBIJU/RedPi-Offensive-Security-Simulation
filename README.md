# üéØ **RedPi: Offensive Security Simulation**

## üõ°Ô∏è **Overview**

This project demonstrates a **controlled phishing simulation** using a **Raspberry Pi** as the attacker system and a Windows 11 machine as the target. The project showcases **red team tactics** to understand attacker methodologies and improve cybersecurity defenses. It includes key operations such as:
- Phishing campaigns
- Payload deployment
- Reverse engineering
- Command-and-control (C2) management

The project utilizes tools like **Postfix**, **Dovecot**, and **Roundcube** for simulating email-based phishing attacks and applies the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to analyze each phase of the attack.

## üöÄ **Features**
- **Phishing Simulation**: Automates the process of crafting  and sending phishing emails with malicious payloads using Raspberry Pi
- **Payload Deployment**: Deploys Fully Undetectable (FUD) payloads created with Windows PowerShell, bypassing Windows 11 security features.
- **Reverse Engineering**: Raspberry Pi acts as a platform for analyzing and refining attack strategies.
- **Command-and-Control (C2) by Raspberry Pi**: Manages reverse shell connections for tasks like privilege escalation and data exfiltration.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks attack progress and sends alerts for successful payload execution or interruptions.
- **MITRE ATT&CK Integration**: Maps tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for structured analysis.
